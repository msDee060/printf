# Printf

Printf is the C language to do formatted printing.
It is found in the stdio.h heade file.

In this project my partner and I will create our own version of the C prinf function.

### Files

All files are written in C.

0) A function that produces output according to a format

Should handle 'c' 's' and '%'.

1)The function should hold the 'd' and 'i' conversion specifiers.

2)Should handle custom conversion specifiers.

3 -- 15) Should work just like the real printf function.
